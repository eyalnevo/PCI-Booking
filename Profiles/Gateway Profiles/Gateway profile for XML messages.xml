<!-- The request definition tells the gateway which messages to search for - based on the filter specified. Messages that do not match
     the specific filter will be ignored and will pass through as-is. For messages that do match the filter, the gateway will apply
     the content filter to read the card details from the message body. Optionally, a replace filter can be added as well to indicate
     to the gateway that a token replacement must occur in the response sent back through the gateway. -->
